     <p>Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
Jingle all the way<br>
Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
In a one-horse open sleigh(x4)</p>

<p>Dashing through the snow
<br>In a one-horse open sleigh
<br>O'er the fields we go
<br>Laughing all the way
<br>Bells on bobtails ring
<br>Making spirits bright
<br>What fun it is to ride and sing
<br>A sleighing song tonight</p>
   
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>Jingle all the way<br>
Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
In a one-horse open sleigh(x4)</p>
<p>A day or two ago<br>
I thought I'd take a ride<br>
And soon, Miss Fanny Bright<br>
Was seated by my side<br>
The horse was lean and lank<br>
Misfortune seemed his lot<br>
He got into a drifted bank<br>
And then we got upsot</p>

<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells<br>
Jingle all the way<br>
Oh, what fun it is to ride<br>
In a one-horse open sleigh(x4)</p></b><hr>
